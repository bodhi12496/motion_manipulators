# 7 DOF Motion Manipulators

A 7-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) motion manipulator refers to a robotic arm or manipulator that has seven different ways it can move in its workspace. Each degree of freedom corresponds to a unique motion axis, allowing the robot to achieve a variety of complex movements and orientations. The seven degrees of freedom are typically classified as follows:

- Translation along the x-axis: Movement in a straight line along the x-axis.
- Translation along the y-axis: Movement in a straight line along the y-axis.
- Translation along the z-axis: Movement in a straight line along the z-axis.
- Roll (rotation around the x-axis): Rotation around the x-axis.
- Pitch (rotation around the y-axis): Rotation around the y-axis.
- Yaw (rotation around the z-axis): Rotation around the z-axis.
- Gripper or End Effector Rotation: Rotation of the end effector or gripper.
The extra degrees of freedom in a 7-DOF manipulator compared to, for example, a 6-DOF manipulator, provide increased flexibility and capability for performing a wider range of tasks. Here's why a 7-DOF motion manipulator might be needed:

Workspace Flexibility: A higher degree of freedom allows the manipulator to reach and manipulate objects in a larger workspace and from a wider range of angles.

Redundancy Resolution: The additional degree of freedom can be used for redundancy resolution. This means that even if one configuration is blocked, the robot can still find alternative configurations to reach the same point.

Task Complexity: Certain tasks, especially those in unstructured or dynamic environments, may require more complex motion. For example, assembling parts in a three-dimensional space or navigating around obstacles may be facilitated by additional degrees of freedom.

Optimal Path Planning: A 7-DOF manipulator can provide more flexibility in choosing optimal paths to reach a target, which is crucial for tasks that involve avoiding obstacles or minimizing energy consumption.

Manipulating Objects with Varying Orientations: Some tasks, such as picking and placing objects with arbitrary orientations, benefit from the additional rotational degrees of freedom.

Improved Dexterity: The increased degrees of freedom enhance the manipulator's dexterity, making it more adaptable to diverse and challenging tasks.

Advanced Control: The complexity of certain tasks may require sophisticated control algorithms, and having more degrees of freedom can provide more options for achieving desired motions.

##  Objectives:

- advanced robotic system that can perform complex manipulation tasks with enhanced intelligence and adaptability, almost 2 times faster with the help of neural models.
- Used predefined data of other smaller DOF robots to create the correct functioning of the motion manipulator using control algorithms like PID (proportional Integral derivative) and testing it in an artificial environment like Gazebo.
